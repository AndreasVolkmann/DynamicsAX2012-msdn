# About the Application Workspace 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Application Workspace in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 is the end-user view of the client. The Application Workspace displays only the user interface elements needed for end-users.

By default, the client opens in the Application workspace. To open a Development Workspace, press CTRL + Shift + W. You can also open Microsoft Dynamics AX directly into a Development Workspace. For more information, see [How to: Open a Development Workspace](how-to-open-a-development-workspace.md).

The Application Workspace is used by developers to see customizations in the context of the end-user. For example, if you create a new form, the form can be opened directly from the AOT in the Development Workspace. However, opening the form using the display menu item in the context of the end-user can only be done through the Application Workspace. Any changes that are made in the Development Workspace can be immediately viewed in the Application Workspace.

Application Workspace windows sizing and location preferences are automatically saved when you close the Application Workspace independent of any preferences set in the Development Workspace.
